Web Components
==============
Most of the concepts in this library have been explained with the help of web-based analogies, this is not because the
library is specific to the web, rather, it is simply because the most common way for users to interact with systems in
the modern world is via a (mobile) web browser.

This section is all about those components that *are* specific to the web.
