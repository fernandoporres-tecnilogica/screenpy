Reporting
=========

This library integrates with the `allure <http://allure.qatools.ru/>`_ reporting tool.  It's a beautiful, configurable
reporting solution that allows us to produce detailed reports on our tests.

Every built-in interaction and question comes with the reporting capability baked-in.  All the major test runners come
with plug-ins that ensure that the allure lifecycle plugs into the test lifecycle.

We prefer `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_, but your test runner is your choice!

For more information on how to configure the your test runner to work with Allure - see the documentation of your chosen
tool.
