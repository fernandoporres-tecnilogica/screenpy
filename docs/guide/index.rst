The screenplay pattern originated in 2016 by many of the people working on Selenium and the Serenity project.  If you're
so inclined, read about it in the original `article <https://dzone.com/articles/page-objects-refactored-solid-steps-to-the-screenp>`_.
If you're not so inclined, don't worry - we'll cover the basics here.

From time to time, we might also reference the `serenity-js <https://serenity-js.org/design/screenplay-pattern.html>`_
documentation as they've done an excellent job of distilling the ideas expressed in the original article.
In their own words,

    The Screenplay Pattern is a user-centred model, which helps you shift the focus of automated acceptance tests from
    low-level interactions with the system to thinking about who the users of your system are, what is that they want to
    achieve by their interaction with your system and how exactly they're going to do it.


The next few pages will guide you through the first steps of getting your tests up and running.  At the end of it, you will
have a working test that will demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and get you familiar with most of the key
principles.
